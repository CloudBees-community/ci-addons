So you've got an esoteric piece of software that you need in your build?

It's quite large; or takes quite some time to compile

Create a job to install it 
* well known location
* can run the installation on it's
* can run it as a matrix build to install multiple different version
* is always synced back to the main workspace


Create a job to use it



We recommend using two scripts

* install-addon
* run-addon
